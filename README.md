# Fact-checking Twitter-bot

## Intro

A simple Python mini-app to correct people who share inaccurate information on Twitter. You can run this [Flask app](flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/quickstart/) locally to input links of fake stories and to their respective debunking on an online spreadsheet. Not much coding required. You just need to put the variables on a .env file, install the requirements and type `flask run`.


## Installation

The easiest way to run online: clone (download) this repository and get it running on Heroku. You'll need:  

* A [free Heroku account](https://www.heroku.com/);  
* [Github account](https://github.com/);  
* Access to a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) account (you can use your own);
* A Bit.ly account.
* [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your machine (to run tests locally);

Store all the variables (Twitter access keys, Bit.ly, atc) in the Heroku app. Connect your Git repository to Heroku and you’re almost set! You’ll need to schedule a couple of commands to run from time to time.
